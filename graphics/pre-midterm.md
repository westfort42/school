Lecture 1
=========

*Sep 9*

The course now uses WebGL and JavaScript. This is good for me, because I don't know C++. There are two different marking schemes: you can either do two or three projects, depending on how much you want your final mark to be. Begin project ASAP.

See mockup for first assignment. The goal of the game is to contain the ball in a small area in the centre of the playing field. Upon submission, file name should be something like, bwtrante.zip.

Lecture 2
=========

*Sep 11*

Like any good CS Student, nobody has managed to figure out how to get the simplest example of WebGL running, or even type `<canvas></canvas>` into a file named `index.html`. I think we're going to learn that today.

Also, there is a math library we can use that is included with the textbook. This includes a bunch of complicated linear algebra functions.  It's called something like `MV.js`. There are a few other helper libraries included as well, like ones that help with sending data to the GPU.

######Task 1: Get the most basic example in the world up and running, and then play around with it. You can do that by clicking this link (desktop Chrome only): [http://lakeheadu.cadesire2learn.com/].

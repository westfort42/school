For this project, why not try to do something interesting? Make the project but setup a little node server with websockets, and make the mobile view a game controller, and the web view the project (obvs). Since stupid phones can't even run WebGL, it's a good opportunity to do something cool. Also try adding a highscore module using localstorage or IndexedDB or something. You could make it someone in the class can control the the shooting character guy through their phone, so it's like a real videogame.

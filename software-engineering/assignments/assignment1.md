##Description
You are asked to do some requirement development. Suppose you are asked to develop a booking system for a public library system. The system is not necessarily online.

2. Identify stakeholders of the system. Select one important stakeholder and design a list of questions for interviewing that stakeholder.

3. Give functional requirements and quality requirements of the system.

4. Create a list of use cases and describe two of them in detail using the method discussed in class (two-column method). Then draw use cases diagram to describe the system. Indicate extension, generalization and inclusion, if there are any.

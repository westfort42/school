##Assignment 3

######You are ask to do some modelling development of a Bank accounts management system using the methods in lectures. Review the materials in Chapters 5 and 6 before solve the problems. The following Problems 1 - 4 are all about this system.

The description of the system is as follows:

> This system provides the basic services to manage bank accounts at a bank called LUBank. LUBank has many branches, each of which has an address and branch number. A client opens accounts at a branch. Each account is uniquely identified by a account number; it has a balance and a credit or overdraft limit. There are many types of accounts, including : a mortgage account (which has a property as collateral), a checking account, and a credit card account (which has an expiry date and can have secondary cards attached to it). It is possible to have a joint account (e.g., for a husband and wife). Each type of account has a particular interest rate, a monthly fee and a specific set of privileges (e.g. ability to write checks, insurance for purchases etc.). LUBank is divided into divisions and subdivisions (such as Plan-
ning, Investments and Consumer); the branches are considered subdivisions of the Consumer Division. Each division has a manager and a set of other employees. Each customer is assigned a particular employee as his or her ‘personal banker’.

*Sep 9*

Figure out what we actually have to do for the project - Dr Wei says mobile compatibility, what does that really mean? Write the API in Java and the front-end in Ember?

Group Project: 	Derek - API/ORM
		Issac - ORM/Server-side logic
		McCutcheons - DB
		Me - Client-side

For the project, we can use whatever crappy ole thing we want, like Rails or Node or Meteor but never PHP. Make a little babby mockup in Meteor to convince them of that being the worlds easiest technology.

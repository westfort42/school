Figure out what we actually have to do for the project - Dr Wei says mobile compatibility, what does that really mean? Write the API in Java and the front-end in Ember?

Group Project: 	
- Derek - API/ORM
- Issac - ORM/Server-side logic
- McCutcheons - DB
- Me - Client-side

For the project, we can use whatever crappy ole thing we want, like Rails or Node or Meteor but never PHP. Make a little babby mockup in Meteor to convince them of that being the worlds easiest technology.

Software is hard to understand, easy to reproduce (low cost, and you can just hit copy and paste to reproduce it), and labor intensive (you can't automate it)

Sofrware can never be perfect..

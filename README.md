####Overview

These are my school notes, projects, and other stuff from the Fall 2014 semester. If you're in one of my classes, I'll give you committing rights :). I basically just did this so I can read my notes on my phone easily.

####File Structure

Everything is divided up by class, and each class has notes for everythng pre and post midterm. Each class also has a project folder, which contains all the source code of my assignments. The readme for each file is usually the assignment description along with my own personal thoughts and comments.

####Is this allowed?

I dunno, I guess we'll see.

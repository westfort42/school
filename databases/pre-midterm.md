Network Databses: Have a one-to-many relationship, ie, a doctor has many patients.

Relational: Have a many-to-one relationship, ie, each patient has a doctor.

####Relational

Is based upon a key-value store (*single field primary key*). These relational databases are two-dimensional. There are also multidimensional database architectures (these are usually used in data warehousing).

Types of Database Applications:

- Personal: one user, client only.
- Two tier: less than 100 users, client/server communicate directly.
- Three tier: less than 1000 users, client/server communicate through some application server (like a web server) which talks to a database management system).

This course is basically just about SQL databases, and Allaire likes to use MS Access. As a mac user, this is a real kick in the dick.
